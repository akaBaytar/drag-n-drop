## Drag 'n Drop

- Drag 'n Drop object oriented programming project designed to aid my learning process in TypeScript and OOP. 
- This project incorporates TypeScript-specific syntax rules such as interfaces, decorators and TypeScript data types like enum and unions. 
- I organized TypeScript files into folders using ES6 modules to enhance the efficiency of the development process. 
- Finally, I compiled the project with Webpack, creating a bundled JS file.
- This project has been a valuable contribution to my learning journey with Typescript and OOP.
